# Design for Switchbase

## Major requirements
* A database of all switch types exists
* It can be searched by various fields, either individually or in combination (manufacturer, switch type, manufacturer AND switch type, Manufacturer NOT clicky etc.)
* Compatibility of parts should be highlighted
* User accounts
* Reviews and ratings can be left
* A search can be ordered by rating.

## Minor requirements
* User accounts split between Admin and user.
* profanity filter
* images


## Requirements to be categorised
* Provides links to OEM data for stock switches/suppliers
* Has cost values (linked to current market prices from lists of suppliers?) for OEM stock switches
* Has cost values submitted by users for custom switch combinations
* Ability to add/link sound samples?
* Ability to Submit a name for a custom, with vote system, and the highest vote at time of viewing is the displayed community name. This can be exceptioned for existing known combinations widely accepted as its name, e.g. Holy Panda.
* Includes switch-related accessories, e.g. lubes, switch opening tools, films? that can also be reviewed/costed.


## Questions
* What attributes of a switch determine compatability (ideas: length, width, height, housing shape, stem shape, stem size, spring size, spring weight)
* Did we want users to be able to select or provide components to "create/conceptualize" their own switch and see if its compatabile
